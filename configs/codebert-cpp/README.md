This is a `microsoft/codebert-base-mlm` model, trained for 1,000,000 steps (with `batch_size=32`)  on **C++** code from the `codeparrot/github-code-clean` dataset, on the masked-language-modeling task.

It is intended to be used in CodeBERTScore: [https://github.com/neulab/code-bert-score](https://github.com/neulab/code-bert-score), but can be used for any other model or task.
